During my free time between classes I would create console applications, mods for popular games, and my own projects using the Unity and GMS2 game engines. Those projects made me love problem solving, UX design, and led me to want to study programming further at NSS",

The Plaid API is also trusted and used by other software like Robinhood and RocketMoney. It has been a blast working with Plaid and Blazor MAUI to build this program.
